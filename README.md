## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and technologies used

We use the following techniques and technologies:

- `Lazy Layouts`: performance optimization of implementations of rows or columns with many elements
- `OutlinedTextField`: text field implementation with Material Design standards
- `State management`: use of mutable states to react to changes in the text field
- `Slot-based customization`: flexible customization in specific locations of certain composables
- `Dynamic content presentation`: exploration of the technique to present or not present content depending on the state
- `Standard Modifier`: flexibility to customize composables at the component level
- `Filter implementation`: conscious use of computational codes within composables
- `State Hoisting`: technique for reusing composables that need state management allowing the invoker to be responsible for the state
